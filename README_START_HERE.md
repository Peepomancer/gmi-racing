## 🚀 QUICK START GUIDE

### **Step 1: Read the Docs (15 min)**
```
1. Read ENGINE_EDITOR_DOCUMENTATION.md
   → Understand the vision
   
2. Skim GMI_Racing_Goals_and_Roadmap.md
   → See the full plan
   
3. Read ULTIMATE_VIBE_CODING_PROMPT.md
   → Know what you're building
```

---

### **Step 2: Start Building (Right Now!)**

```bash
# Open your terminal

# Navigate to where you want the project
cd ~/Projects/

# Start Claude Code CLI
claude-code

# Or if you don't have it installed yet:
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**Then in Claude Code:**

```
PASTE THE ENTIRE ULTIMATE_VIBE_CODING_PROMPT.md

(Yes, all ~20,000 words. Claude can handle it.)
```

**Claude will:**
1. Create the project structure
2. Set up Electron
3. Build React components
4. Create the UI framework
5. Implement Phase 1 (Core Framework)

---

### **Step 3: Test Phase 1 (Same Day)**

```bash
# Claude will tell you to run:
npm install
npm start

# The editor should launch!
# You'll see:
# - Dark themed window
# - Sidebar with tabs
# - Empty panels (that's OK, we'll fill them)
```

---

### **Step 4: Add Features (Next Few Days)**

After Phase 1 works, tell Claude:

```
"Great! Now build Phase 2: Race Settings panel.
Follow the design in the prompt."
```

Claude builds Phase 2.

Test it.

Then:

```
"Now build Phase 3: Item Editor."
```

Repeat for each phase.

---

### **Step 5: Balance the Game (Week 3-5)**

Once all panels are built:

1. Open the editor
2. Adjust sliders
3. Test races
4. Find perfect balance
5. Save configs
6. Repeat

---

### **Step 6: Add Your Visuals (Week 5-6)**

1. Create animations in After Effects
2. Export as Lottie JSON
3. Drop in `assets/` folder
4. Link in Asset Manager
5. Test with visuals

## 🎯 REMEMBER THE GOAL

**Build the editor. Not the game.**

The editor lets you build the game visually.

Once the editor exists:
- Everything is faster
- Everything is easier
- Everything is visual

**Build the tool. Use the tool. Make the game. Launch. Profit.**
